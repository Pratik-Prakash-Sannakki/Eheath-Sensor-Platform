/*
 *  eHealth sensor platform for Arduino and Raspberry from Cooking-hacks.
 *
 *  Description: "The e-Health Sensor Shield allows Arduino and Raspberry Pi 
 *  users to perform biometric and medical applications by using 9 different 
 *  sensors: Pulse and Oxygen in Blood Sensor (SPO2), Airflow Sensor (Breathing),
 *  Body Temperature, Electrocardiogram Sensor (ECG), Glucometer, Galvanic Skin
 *  Response Sensor (GSR - Sweating), Blood Pressure (Sphygmomanometer) and 
 *  Patient Position (Accelerometer)."
 *
 *  In this example we read the values in volts of EMG sensor and show
 *  these values in the serial monitor.
